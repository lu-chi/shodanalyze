===========
Basic script concept is to extract ip/port router access details from shodan xml file and check/confirm device accessibility with hping3 half-open scan (syn). Next things to add are:
- ack, fin, xmass scan
- script rebuild with classes etc.
- shodan user API import
- 'mechanize' lib for router default credentials
- device DoS vulnerability check
- device banner grabbing
